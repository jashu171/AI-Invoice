## API Endpoints

### Web Interface
- `GET /` - Main dashboard with processed invoices
- `POST /upload` - Upload and process invoice files
- `GET /invoice/<id>` - View detailed invoice information
- `GET /invoice/<id>/structured` - View structured data format

### File Management
- `GET /uploads/<filename>` - Access uploaded files
- `GET /processed/<filename>` - Access processed JSON files

## Data Format

Processed invoices are saved as JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-001",
  "date": "2024-01-15",
  "vendor": "Company Name",
  "total": "1250.00",
  "line_items": [...],
  "processed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "extraction_method": "gemini_ai",
  "structured_data": {
    "invoice_metadata": {...},
    "vendor_details": {...},
    "customer_details": {...},
    "line_items": [...],
    "summary": {...}
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tesseract not found**
   - Ensure Tesseract is installed and in your PATH
   - On macOS: `brew install tesseract`
   - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

2. **Poor OCR results**
   - Ensure images are high quality and well-lit
   - PDFs with embedded text work better than scanned images
   - Try preprocessing images (contrast, brightness) before upload

3. **AI extraction not working**
   - Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correct
   - Check your Google Cloud billing is enabled
   - Ensure you have API quota remaining

4. **File upload fails**
   - Check file size (max 16MB)
   - Verify file format is supported
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

### Logs and Debugging

Enable debug mode by setting `DEBUG=true` in your `.env` file. This will provide detailed error messages and logging information.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run AI extraction tests
python testing\ files/test_ai_extraction.py

# Run simple AI tests
python testing\ files/simple_ai_test.py
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Custom Extraction Rules**: Modify patterns in `app.py` `InvoiceProcessor` class
2. **New Data Fields**: Update `structured_data.py` data models
3. **UI Improvements**: Edit templates in `templates/` directory
4. **Styling**: Modify CSS files in `static/css/`

## Security Considerations

- Change the default `SECRET_KEY` in production
- Keep your Gemini API key secure and never commit it to version control
- Consider implementing file type validation beyond extensions
- Set up proper error handling for production deployment

## Performance Tips

- Use high-quality, well-lit images for better OCR results
- PDFs with embedded text process faster than scanned images
- Consider implementing file size limits based on your server capacity
- Monitor API usage to avoid exceeding Gemini API quotas
